                <p>This privacy policy applies to the Ramadan - Prayer Times & Calendar app (hereby referred to as
                    "Application") for mobile devices that was created by September Developer (hereby referred to as
                    "Service Provider") as an Ad Supported service.</p>

                    <li>Your device's Internet Protocol address (e.g. IP address)</li>
                    <li>The pages of the Application that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on
                        those pages</li>
                    <li>The time spent on the Application</li>
                    <li>The operating system you use on your mobile device</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The Application does not gather precise information about the location of your mobile device.</p>

                <h3>Third Party Access</h3>
                <p>Only aggregated, anonymized data is periodically transmitted to external services to aid the Service
                    Provider in improving the Application and their service. The Service Provider may share your
                    information with third parties in the ways that are described in this privacy statement.</p>

                    about handling data. Below are the links to the Privacy Policy of the third-party service providers
                    used by the Application:</p>

                    reasonable time thereafter. If you'd like them to delete User Provided Data that you have provided

                    approval of all changes.</p>

            <!-- Terms & Conditions Section -->
            <div class="section">
                <h2>Terms & Conditions</h2>
                <div class="effective-date">
                    Effective Date: January 19, 2026
                </div>

                <p>These terms and conditions apply to the Ramadan - Prayer Times & Calendar app (hereby referred to as
                    "Application") for mobile devices that was created by September Developer (hereby referred to as
                    "Service Provider") as an Ad Supported service.</p>

                <p>Upon downloading or utilizing the Application, you are automatically agreeing to the following terms.
                    It is strongly advised that you thoroughly read and understand these terms prior to using the
                    Application.</p>

                <h3>Intellectual Property</h3>
                <p>Unauthorized copying, modification of the Application, any part of the Application, or our trademarks
                    is strictly prohibited. Any attempts to extract the source code of the Application, translate the
                    Application into other languages, or create derivative versions are not permitted. All trademarks,
                    copyrights, database rights, and other intellectual property rights related to the Application
                    remain the property of the Service Provider.</p>

                <h3>Service Modifications</h3>
                <p>The Service Provider is dedicated to ensuring that the Application is as beneficial and efficient as
                    possible. As such, they reserve the right to modify the Application or charge for their services at
                    any time and for any reason. The Service Provider assures you that any charges for the Application
                    or its services will be clearly communicated to you.</p>

                <h3>User Responsibilities</h3>
                <p>The Application stores and processes personal data that you have provided to the Service Provider in
                    order to provide the Service. It is your responsibility to maintain the security of your phone and
                    access to the Application. The Service Provider strongly advise against jailbreaking or rooting your
                    phone, which involves removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official
                    operating system of your device. Such actions could expose your phone to malware, viruses, malicious
                    programs, compromise your phone's security features, and may result in the Application not
                    functioning correctly or at all.</p>

                <h3>Third-Party Services</h3>
                <p>Please note that the Application utilizes third-party services that have their own Terms and
                    Conditions. Below are the links to the Terms and Conditions of the third-party service providers
                    used by the Application:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google
                            Play Services</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://developers.google.com/admob/terms" target="_blank"

                            rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Analytics for Firebase</a></li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Service Limitations</h3>
                <p>Please be aware that the Service Provider does not assume responsibility for certain aspects. Some
                    functions of the Application require an active internet connection, which can be Wi-Fi or provided
                    by your mobile network provider. The Service Provider cannot be held responsible if the Application
                    does not function at full capacity due to lack of access to Wi-Fi or if you have exhausted your data
                    allowance.</p>

                <p>If you are using the application outside of a Wi-Fi area, please be aware that your mobile network
                    provider's agreement terms still apply. Consequently, you may incur charges from your mobile
                    provider for data usage during the connection to the application, or other third-party charges. By
                    using the application, you accept responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data
                    charges if you use the application outside of your home territory (i.e., region or country) without
                    disabling data roaming.</p>

                <h3>Application Updates</h3>
                <p>The Service Provider may wish to update the application at some point. The application is currently
                    available as per the requirements for the operating system (and for any additional systems they
                    decide to extend the availability of the application to) may change, and you will need to download
                    the updates if you want to continue using the application. The Service Provider does not guarantee
                    that it will always update the application so that it is relevant to you and/or compatible with the
                    particular operating system version installed on your device. However, you agree to always accept
                    updates to the application when offered to you.</p>

                <h3>Termination</h3>
                <p>The Service Provider may also wish to cease providing the application and may terminate its use at
                    any time without providing termination notice to you. Unless they inform you otherwise, upon any
                    termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must cease
                    using the application, and (if necessary) delete it from your device.</p>

                <h3>Changes to Terms</h3>
                <p>The Service Provider may periodically update their Terms and Conditions. Therefore, you are advised
                    to review this page regularly for any changes. The Service Provider will notify you of any changes
                    by posting the new Terms and Conditions on this page.</p>

                <h3>Contact Us</h3>
                <p>If you have any questions or suggestions about the Privacy Policy or Terms and Conditions, please do
                    not hesitate to contact the Service Provider at <a
